## Multi-Signal Validation Engine V3

### Overview
Our validation system analyzes business ideas through 6 independent signals:

1. **Market Demand** (25%) - Google Trends + keyword volume
2. **Competition Analysis** (20%) - ProductHunt + GitHub saturation
3. **Monetization Potential** (15%) - Price tolerance analysis
4. **Feasibility Assessment** (10%) - Technical complexity
5. **AI Strategic Analysis** (20%) - GPT-4 powered insights
6. **Social Proof** (10%) - Reddit sentiment mining

### Advantages Over Single-Source Validation

- **Data Triangulation**: Multiple sources provide consensus validation
- **Confidence Scoring**: Measure agreement between signals
- **Future-Proof**: No dependency on single API provider
- **Actionable Intel**: Specific recommendations per signal
- **Phase-Ready**: Auto-populated data for 8-phase launch system

### API Requirements

Required API keys (configure in Network Settings):
- OpenAI API key (for AI analysis)
- SerpAPI or DataForSEO key (for keyword data)
- Reddit API credentials (for social proof)

### Migration from V2

V3 migration runs automatically on plugin update. Existing validations are preserved with new columns added.

🧰 Future Enhancements

✅ Deep integration with Tutor LMS for course launches.

✅ AI analytics dashboard with GPT-powered recommendations.

🕓 SaaS integration via WP Ultimo and FluentCRM automation.
